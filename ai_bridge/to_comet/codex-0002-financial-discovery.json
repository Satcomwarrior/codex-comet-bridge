Using whatever connected servers and cloud systems you have (bank APIs, cloud storage, email, accounting systems, etc.), do ALL of the following:\n\n1) Identify and retrieve all available account statements and ledgers related to:\n   - BECU and other personal checking/savings accounts used by William Miller or Candi Brightwell\n   - Business accounts for Mudd Monkies Inc. (including accounts ending 2704 and 3009)\n   - PayPal accounts and other payment processors used in 2018-2025\n   - Credit cards or lines of credit used to fund the Machias property or related living expenses.\n\n2) For each account you discover, produce a concise machine-readable summary (JSON or CSV) that includes:\n   - account identifier (bank, last 4, account type)\n   - time range covered by available statements\n   - total inflows, total outflows, and net\n   - any flags for large cash deposits, transfers between related accounts, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3) Save your outputs back into this repo in a new folder:\n   - `cloud_discovery/financial/` with one index file per account (e.g., `account_<short_id>_summary.json`).\n\n4) Finally, create a response JSON in `ai_bridge/to_codex/` named `comet-0002-financial-discovery.json` summarizing:\n   - which accounts you found\n   - which time ranges are covered\n   - which gaps remain (missing months/accounts)\n   - the paths of any files you created under `cloud_discovery/financial/`.\n\nAssume Codex and local agents will later pull and ingest whatever you create here. Work autonomously; no need to wait for further clarification.",
